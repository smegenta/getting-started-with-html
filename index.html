  <b>The Basics of the Web:</b>
<p>The web is comprised of the following pieces:</p>
<b>Web Browser</b> - A disply program on a computer to display content.<br>
<b>Servers</b> - Computers that host files.<br>
<b>Http</b> - Communication protocol. <br>
<b>Internet</b> - A network of computers.<br>

<p>
HTML is the heart of the web and is composed of the following parts:<br><br>
<b>Text</b> - This is basically what gets displayed. <br>
<b>Markup</b> - This controls the style of the text that is diaplyed. <br><br>
An HTML may also contain references to other kinds of documents such as images and video. 
It may also contain links to other pages
</p>      

<b>Markups</b><br><br>

A Markup element is made of an opening tag, a content and closing tags. <br>
Opening tags may have values.<br>
Some markups do not have contants and are said to be void markups.<br>
Void tags do not need closing tag.

<b>Some example of tags:</b><br><br>
a - anchor for making links <br>
img - for images and has src and alt attributes<br>
br - page break<br>
p - make paragraphs<br><br>

The difference between the line break and paragraph tag is that the first one is an inline tag while the latter is a block tag.

<p><b>HTML Documents</b></p>
An HTML document has two parts. A head and body.<br>
The Head contains meta data about the document including the title of the document.
The Body is basically where the content of the document is written.
